### A04:2021 â€“ **Insecure Design**  

#### Overview
**Insecure Design** is a new category introduced in the 2021 OWASP Top 10, highlighting risks stemming from **design and architectural flaws** in applications. These flaws go beyond implementation mistakes, focusing instead on insufficient forethought during the design phase of application development. 

The category calls for more proactive practices like:
- **Threat Modeling**: Identifying and analyzing potential threats early in the design process.
- **Secure Design Patterns**: Applying proven solutions to common security challenges.
- **Reference Architectures**: Using well-vetted architectural blueprints to guide secure application development.

It emphasizes moving beyond traditional "shift-left" practices, which focus on security in the coding phase, to include **pre-coding activities** that embody the principles of "Secure by Design."

### Key Factors and Statistics
1. **Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) Mapped**: 40  
   Examples include:
   - **CWE-209**: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information  
   - **CWE-256**: Unprotected Storage of Credentials  
   - **CWE-501**: Trust Boundary Violation  
   - **CWE-522**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials  

2. **Statistics**:
   - **Max Incidence Rate**: 24.19%  
     Indicates the highest frequency of insecure design occurrences across surveyed applications.
   - **Avg Incidence Rate**: 3.00%  
     The average occurrence rate for this vulnerability type.
   - **Avg Weighted Exploit**: 6.46  
     A measure of how likely these vulnerabilities are to be exploited, averaged across instances.
   - **Avg Weighted Impact**: 6.78  
     Reflects the average severity or damage potential of such exploits.
   - **Max Coverage**: 77.25%  
     The highest proportion of applications in which this issue was detected.
   - **Avg Coverage**: 42.51%  
     The average percentage of applications containing this issue.

3. **Occurrences and CVEs**:
   - **Total Occurrences**: 262,407  
     Total instances of insecure design detected.
   - **Total CVEs**: 2,691  
     Number of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) linked to insecure design flaws.

### Why This Matters
**Insecure Design** issues often emerge when:
- Threats are not adequately anticipated during the design phase.
- Secure design principles, such as data minimization or secure defaults, are not applied.
- Critical functionalities (like authentication, error handling, or data storage) lack proper design controls.

This category underscores the importance of:
- Investing in **early-phase security activities**, such as architectural risk assessments.
- Reducing the cost of security fixes by preventing flaws **before coding begins**.
- Training developers and architects on secure design practices.

### Practical Takeaways
1. **Prevention Strategies**:
   - Conduct **threat modeling sessions** during the design phase.
   - Use **secure design frameworks** and principles.
   - Leverage tools for **design-time validation**, such as automated security architecture analysis.

2. **Examples of Poor Design**:
   - Storing passwords in plaintext instead of hashing them securely.
   - Allowing verbose error messages that leak sensitive information (e.g., stack traces in production).
   - Failing to implement least privilege for sensitive operations or users.

3. **Key Challenges**:
   - Lack of awareness about design risks among teams.
   - Pressure to deliver features quickly, sacrificing security considerations.
   - Over-reliance on downstream testing or security fixes rather than addressing root causes.

### Final Notes
Insecure design vulnerabilities are harder to mitigate post-implementation. By embedding security early in the software development lifecycle, organizations can significantly lower the risks and costs associated with these flaws.
