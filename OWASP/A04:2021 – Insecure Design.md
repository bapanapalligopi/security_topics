### A04:2021 – **Insecure Design**  

#### Overview
**Insecure Design** is a new category introduced in the 2021 OWASP Top 10, highlighting risks stemming from **design and architectural flaws** in applications. These flaws go beyond implementation mistakes, focusing instead on insufficient forethought during the design phase of application development. 

The category calls for more proactive practices like:
- **Threat Modeling**: Identifying and analyzing potential threats early in the design process.
- **Secure Design Patterns**: Applying proven solutions to common security challenges.
- **Reference Architectures**: Using well-vetted architectural blueprints to guide secure application development.

It emphasizes moving beyond traditional "shift-left" practices, which focus on security in the coding phase, to include **pre-coding activities** that embody the principles of "Secure by Design."

### Why This Matters
**Insecure Design** issues often emerge when:
- Threats are not adequately anticipated during the design phase.
- Secure design principles, such as data minimization or secure defaults, are not applied.
- Critical functionalities (like authentication, error handling, or data storage) lack proper design controls.

This category underscores the importance of:
- Investing in **early-phase security activities**, such as architectural risk assessments.
- Reducing the cost of security fixes by preventing flaws **before coding begins**.
- Training developers and architects on secure design practices.

---

### Practical Takeaways
1. **Prevention Strategies**:
   - Conduct **threat modeling sessions** during the design phase.
   - Use **secure design frameworks** and principles.
   - Leverage tools for **design-time validation**, such as automated security architecture analysis.

2. **Examples of Poor Design**:
   - Storing passwords in plaintext instead of hashing them securely.
   - Allowing verbose error messages that leak sensitive information (e.g., stack traces in production).
   - Failing to implement least privilege for sensitive operations or users.

3. **Key Challenges**:
   - Lack of awareness about design risks among teams.
   - Pressure to deliver features quickly, sacrificing security considerations.
   - Over-reliance on downstream testing or security fixes rather than addressing root causes.

### **Insecure Design: Description**

**Insecure Design** is a category of vulnerabilities that stems from **missing or ineffective security controls in the design phase** of a system or software. It focuses on weaknesses introduced by flawed architectural decisions rather than coding or implementation errors.

---

### **Key Characteristics**
1. **Not the Source of All Risks**:
   - While many risks in the OWASP Top 10 arise from implementation issues, **Insecure Design** focuses on **flaws in the foundational architecture or design decisions**.
   - Example: A poorly designed user role management system where administrative privileges are granted without proper validation.

2. **Design vs. Implementation**:
   - **Design Flaws**: Issues caused by inadequate planning or consideration during the **architectural phase**.
     - Example: Designing an application without considering secure session management.
   - **Implementation Defects**: Errors made during the **coding phase** that can undermine even a secure design.
     - Example: Incorrectly implementing encryption algorithms in an otherwise securely designed system.

   - **Difference**: 
     - A secure design can result in vulnerabilities due to flawed implementation.
     - An insecure design cannot be rectified even with flawless implementation, as necessary controls were never planned.

3. **Business Risk Profiling**:
   - Many insecure designs result from a **lack of understanding of business risks** during the development process.
   - Example: If a system is built for processing financial transactions but lacks multi-factor authentication, it’s inherently insecure because the **business risk of fraud** wasn’t addressed during design.

4. **Irremediable by Implementation**:
   - Once a security control is omitted during design, no implementation excellence can fix the gap.
   - Example: If no data validation is planned during design, implementing code without any validation will leave the system exposed.

### **Factors Leading to Insecure Design**
1. **Lack of Threat Modeling**:
   - Failing to identify potential attack scenarios and design corresponding defenses.
   - Example: Ignoring the possibility of SQL injection attacks during database interaction design.

2. **Absence of Risk-Based Security Requirements**:
   - Neglecting to assess the **impact of a potential breach** and establish corresponding controls.
   - Example: Designing a healthcare system without considering patient privacy regulations like HIPAA.

3. **Failure to Use Secure Design Principles**:
   - Not leveraging proven security frameworks, patterns, or guidelines.
   - Example: Designing a password reset process without proper identity verification.

---

### **Prevention and Remediation**
1. **Incorporate Security in Design**:
   - Use **threat modeling** to predict potential attack vectors and build defenses.
   - Example: During design, simulate a "man-in-the-middle attack" and plan secure communication channels like TLS.

2. **Adopt Secure by Design Principles**:
   - Leverage principles such as **least privilege**, **secure defaults**, and **defense in depth**.
   - Example: Restrict users to only the permissions required for their roles.

3. **Risk Profiling**:
   - Perform a **business risk assessment** to ensure security levels match the risk exposure of the system.
   - Example: For high-value transactions, design for stronger controls such as biometric verification.

4. **Leverage Security Design Frameworks**:
   - Use established patterns like **zero-trust architectures** or secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices.
   - Example: Employ security-focused design templates for cloud-based systems.

### **Examples of Insecure Design**
1. Designing a web application that does not plan for **session expiration**, allowing attackers to hijack idle sessions.
2. Creating a financial system without **fraud detection mechanisms**, exposing the system to repeated unauthorized transactions.
3. Failing to encrypt sensitive data like user credentials during the design of a storage system.

**Key Insight**: Addressing **Insecure Design** requires organizations to focus on security early in the development lifecycle and continuously integrate security considerations into the architectural process.

### Final Notes
Insecure design vulnerabilities are harder to mitigate post-implementation. By embedding security early in the software development lifecycle, organizations can significantly lower the risks and costs associated with these flaws.
